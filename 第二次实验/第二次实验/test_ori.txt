The Adventure of the Dancing Men

by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

I have had so much to do lately that I exist in a sort of haze, which not even the excitement of a possible nor'-wester this afternoon has done anything to shake off. 
It is not my nature, however, to lose heart, and I am gradually emerging from the shadows. 
My dear Watson, I owe my very real recovery to you. 
Not only did you take away the immediate causes of my languor and depression by your astute diagnosis, but you did not cease to encourage me with your unwavering faith in the future. 
Your pages have given me sunshine when all was cloud. 
It is a joy to me to see you, to know that you are here. 
That is not for my sake, Watson, but for yours. 
It is hard upon you to come to me with your troubles, but you can be sure that if I have health and strength left I shall be only too glad to share them with you.
